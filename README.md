# ons-power-platform

This is a repository that contains the Business Support Products team within the Office for National Statistics' standards, guidance, patterns and practices for using Power Platform and related services. Please note, the majority of these standards assume we are developing using Dataverse as the primary data store and SharePoint for the storage of documents.

All best practices are driven by Microsofts recommendations but should not supersede them.
