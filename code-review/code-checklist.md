Below is a checklist of areas to check when reviewing Power Platform solutions.

| Area | Check | Description | Reason | Additional documentation |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| Canvas app code | N+1 Database or API requests| N+1 queries can found in galleries and can trigger large numbers of requests to data sources. This happen when one or more controls within a gallery are bound to a LookUp/Filter operation on a data source. Ensure minimal or no use of Lookup/Filters on components within a gallery. | Performance and cost - large numbers of queries to a data source can slow down the loading of the canvas app. | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/considerations-for-optimized-performance-in-power-apps/] |
| Canvas app code |	Nested Search, Filter or LookUp operations in formulas | If possible, avoid using nested filters such as Filter(Filter... or Search(Filter.. and instead use a single operation. This can lead to more readable code and potential performance improvements. | Performance, maintainability, and readability. | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-optimization-techniques/ |
| Canvas app code | Code Readability | Avoid code/formulas that are long and hard to read. Examples include nested if/else, nested operators (or, and) and other formulas. Code should be adequately commented. | Readability and maintainability. | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tips-for-a-maintainable-extensible-app/ |
| Canvas app code | Use of concurrent function | Consider using the Concurrent function. This can improve performance by allowing you to load multiple data sources concurrently. | Performance | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-concurrent |
| Canvas app code |	Error Handling |	All relevant components should have error handling. Use IfError when using Patch and use OnSuccess/OnFail for Forms |	Maintainability |	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-iferror |
| Canvas app code |	Use of hardcoded strings | Where possible use dynamically generated content that is configurable. For example, environment variables, Dataverse tables or SharePoint libraries. | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/html-markup-with-dynamic-data/ |
| Canvas app code | LookUp vs Filter Usage - First(Filter(..)) | Consider using LookUp instead of First(Filter. Filter may download a collection of items and will likely always be equivalent or larger than LookUp. | Performance | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tips-for-a-maintainable-extensible-app/ |
| Canvas app code | Unused Formulas, Controls or Assets | Any formulas/assets/controls that might be included in the app but never used, are unnecessary or redundant. | Readability and maintainability | |
| Canvas app code | Delegation | Where possible, delegate processing to data source. For example, when using ClearCollect and Filter operations ensure they are delegable. | Performance | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/delegation-overview </br> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/connections/connection-common-data-service#power-apps-delegable-functions-and-operations-for-dataverse </br> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/common-performance-issue-resolutions#us |
| Canvas app code | Sensitive data | Check for stored hardcoded passwords, secrets and configurations. | Security | |
| Canvas app code | Patch Formula Optimisation | Ensure the second parameter is not using a LookUp. Instead use ThisItem if in a gallery or { id: userid } whenever possible. | Performance | |
| Canvas app code | StartsWith vs In operator | For LookUp and Filter formulas use StartsWith instead of In. StartsWith is delegable to most data sources. | Performance | |
| Canvas app code | Nested API Calls | Avoid making API calls within Filter and LookUp operations | Performance and Readability | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/performance-considerations-with-powerapps/ |
| Canvas app code | Data loading strategy | Review OnStart, OnVisible data loading strategy. Avoid data calls in OnStart and move to OnVisible when possible. Ensure only important data calls block user interaction with UI during initial load of home screen. | Performance and Accessibility	| |
| Canvas app code | Environment variables | Ensure environment variables are used for reused and/or configurable variables and have a suitable description. These could include: <ul><li>The app play link</li><li>SharePoint site collections</li><li>SharePoint list/document library names</li><ul> | Design and Maintainability | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables |
| Canvas app code | Naming convention | Components within app follow agreed naming conventions. | Readability and Maintainability | [Naming conventions](../solutions/canvas-apps/naming-conventions.md) |
| Canvas app design | Layout | Check for consistency in margins, spacing, padding and ensure spelling is correct. | Design | https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/patterns/ </br> https://style.ons.gov.uk/ |
| Canvas app design | App Settings flags | Ensure Delayed Load and Explicit Column Selection is On. These help improve performance by only loading screens when required and only retrieving required data from Dataverse. | Performance | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/app-checker-now-includes-performance-optimization-tips/ </br> http://powerappsguide.com/blog/post/settings-what-does-the-delayed-load-setting-do </br> http://powerappsguide.com/blog/post/how-does-the-explicit-column-selection-setting-work |
| Canvas app design | Control Optimisation | Ensure galleries are use for repeating UI control patterns. For example, menus can use galleries instead of copy pasting elements. Read-only DataCards can be simplified by using galleries. | Maintainability and performance. | |
| Canvas app design | Accessibility | Ensure that the accessibility checker returns no issues and the following properties are set: <ul><li>FocusBorder should be set appropriately.</li><li>All components have an AccessibleLabel</li><li>TabIndex is included for navigable components</li><li>If using states for components state indication text is used</li><li>Helpful control settings are on, for example, markers for charts.</li><li>Screen names should be human readable</li><li>AutoStart is used sparingly if at all. | Accessibility | |
| Canvas app design | Theming Strategy | Ensure theming is consistent with ONS PowerApps approach. | Design | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/guidance/coe/theming-components |
| Canvas app design | Components | Are there any repeating UI elements or reusable features that can be encapsulated in the ONS Core component library. | Maintainability	 | |
| Canvas app design | Cross-screen dependencies | Ensure screen are decoupled one another. Individual screens should not refer to controls in other screens. | Performance and Maintainability | |
| Canvas app design | Consistent Screen And Control Names | Check for consistent naming convention, comments and compact formulas that can lead to better maintenance of the app. | Readability and Maintainability | <ul><li>https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tips-for-a-maintainable-extensible-app/</li><li>https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/comment-your-powerapps-code/</li><li>[Naming conventions](../solutions/canvas-apps/naming-conventions.md)</li><li>[Organising objects and code](../solutions/canvas-apps/organising-objects-and-code.md)</li><li>[General code guidelines](../solutions/canvas-apps/misc-code-guidelines.md)</li></ul> |
| Canvas app design | Uses correct ONS theming | Application uses the ONS theme from the ONS Core components library. | Design and Maintainability | |
| Canvas app design | Application has been run using Monitor | The application should be run using monitor in order to identify if there are any slow points or inefficiencies that can be addressed. | Performance | https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-monitor-to-debug-apps-and-improve-performance/ |
| Canvas app design | Region | Ensure region is set correctly for application. Ensure values like dates are displaying correctly (for example, DD/MM/YYYY). | Design | |
| Connectors | External connectors | If the app uses connectors that extend outside of the O365 platform, third-party connectors or connectors that are on the list of blocked connectors, usage will need to be approved by the relevant groups (technical advisory boards, architecture teams, digital security teams). | Security | |
| Documentation | Release notes | Do release notes exist, detailing which parts of the solution have been added, changed or removed. This will also help the reviewer focus their review. | Maintainability | |
| Documentation | Design document | If a new application, does the application have a high level design document. This should include: <ul><li>High level description.</li><li>Business owner, estimated users, estimated usage.</li><li>Description of components - canvas/model apps, flows, connection references, APIs.</li><li>If there is extensively customised features, detail on the specifics of those features.</li><li>If there is migrated data, information on migration.</li></ul> If this is an update to an existing application, ensure any required updates to documentation are made. | Maintainability and Readability | |
| Documentation | Entity relationship diagrams | If there are new tables, do they have any complex relationships, if so an ERD should be produced to display them. If only updates to tables, do changes impact existing ERDs or add any new complex relationships. | Maintainability and Readability | https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams |
| Entities | Environment and ALM Strategy | Ensure all environments are in place - dev, integration/test, UAT/preprod and prod. Ensure an Azure DevOps project exists for deployment. Ensure any SharePoint sites are created. | | |
| Entities | Data Source Indexing | Ensure proper indices are applied to the data source tables. |  | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization |
| Entities | Makes use of Dataverse views | Ensure any complex views that involve filtering or joining are set up as views in Dataverse. This pushes the computing overhead from the client to the server. | Performance - pushes the overhead to the server rather than the client when loading the application. | http://powerappsguide.com/blog/post/how-to-create-and-use-dataverse-views |
| Entities | DataVerse and SharePoint versioning enabled | Versioning should be enabled for most tables and lists, with the exception of large datasets with a large count of changes to rows where database size would be a consideration. | Performance, Support and Maintainability	| |
| Entities | SharePoint resources | Ensure all resources required in SharePoint (for example, lists, document libraries, groups) have a PnP Provisioning template that has been cleaned and reviewed. | Maintainability | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/pnp-provisioning-schema |
| PCF | PCF code is reviewed and signed | If using custom components written using the Power Apps Component Framework all code will need to be code reviewed and signed off by the relevant groups (technical advisory boards, architecture teams, digital security). | Design and Security | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview |
| Power Automate | Error handling | Ensure suitable error handling is used in flows to allow for graceful handling of errors. | Readability and Maintainability | https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/error-handling/ |
| Solution | Asset Optimisation | Ensure embedded assets are suitably sized and compressed or delivered by CDN if needed. ***ADD NOTE ON CDN*** | Performance |
| Solution | Use of Solutions | Ensure app, flows and other dependencies are within a Solution, are suitable named and versioned. | Readability and Maintainability | |
